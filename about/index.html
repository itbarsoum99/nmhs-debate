          <td>NMHS's debate team is an organization that teaches argumentative and research skills to its members and competes in regularly scheduled debate competitions.</td>
          <td>Members research current event topics, have to explore and form an argument for both sides of an issue, and prepare rebuttals in order to participate competitively.</td>
          <td>Participation in debate counts as IB service hours, can be put on a college application or résumé, and helps to make individuals more open-minded in a world becoming more politically divided.</td>

      <p>The team meets twice a week for after-school practice, from 2:15 to 4:00 PM on Tuesday and Thursday. It participates in regular competitions from September through March, and some students - those who qualify nationally - can participate later in the year.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What commitments do I have to make?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>You must be regularly present at practice and be willing to commit some time to prepare for competition outside of practice. You must also be able to attend some competitions, which mostly occur on Saturday, with some continuing into Sunday. Members must be engaged with one another and able to communicate about topics, preparation, practice, and competition regularly.</p>

      <p>From the founding fathers to the current explosion of online and social media technologies, the principles of open speech and debate have been the life-blood of our democracy, making society stronger by transforming policies, guiding public opinion, and casting light on injustice.Today, it’s more crucial than ever that American teens develop the skills to speak powerfully and persuasively in front of an audience as well as learn to think critically, explore all sides of an issue, and formulate evidence-based, rock-solid points of view. Beyond the improvements in their academic performance that prepare them to excel in college, speech and debate students change in ways that influence every aspect of their lives. It gives them the social and academic confidence they need to grow as individuals, achieve educational goals, pursue meaningful work, and improve the lives of others – and our world.<br /><br />

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What about speech?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>For more information about speech, please visit the official team website at <a href="https://nmhs-debate.netlify.app/">nmhs-debate.netlify.app</a> or contact Mr. Bischoff at <a href="mailto:michaelj.bischoff@cms.k12.nc.us">michaelj.bischoff@cms.k12.nc.us</a>. Speech is an entirely different discipline, that being the reason for the two separate recruiting entities.</p>
