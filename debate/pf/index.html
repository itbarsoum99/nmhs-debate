    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What can the best debaters do?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>Some of the best PF debaters can easily, quickly, and clearly express their arguments in a way that makes sense to the general public. You can view the 2018 NSDA Nationals PF Debate Final Round <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUnyLbeu7qU">here</a> (Resolved: On balance, the benefits of United States participation in the North American Free Trade Agreement outweigh the consequences).</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How do I keep track of the arguments my opponent makes?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>The way that debaters keep track of what arguments have been made in the round is through a method known as “flowing.” Flowing is, essentially, a glorified way of taking notes. Flowing is key to ensuring that you successfully respond, or refute, your opponents case and arguments they make against your case.<br />
       <p>From the <a href="https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/Intro_to_LD.J.Roberts.7.5.27.pdf">Introduction to Lincoln-Douglas Debate</a>. The skill and process of flowing is identical and essential in all of the styles of debate.</p>
