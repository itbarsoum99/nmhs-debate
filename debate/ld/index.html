        <tr>
          <td>Lincoln-Douglas is a 1v1 debate event featuring philosophical topics with logic-based arguments that still requires extensive research and knowledge.</td>
          <td>Competitors do extensive thinking, philosophical reasoning, and research on a bimonthly topic ("resolution") to form arguments and rebuttals in order to prepare for tournaments.</td>
          <td>Competitors prepare at least two cases (one for the resolution, one against) and are informed at the start of debate which side they will be arguing, so teams must be familiar with both cases.</td>

    <div class="fill">
      <p>There are two individuals that debate against each other. There are three affirmative speeches in the round, the "constructive" and two "rebuttals," and two negative speeches, the "constructive" and one "rebuttal." In between some speeches, there is a three-minute cross-examination period. The round is set up as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><hl>Affirmative constructive</hl> (primary arguments): 6 minutes</li>
        <li><hl>Negative cross-exam. of affirmative</hl> (questioning period): 3 minutes</li>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What research is required?</button> 
    <div class="fill">
      <p>One of the most undervalued skills in LD is the ability to efficiently research. The arguments that you present in round will very rarely be your own thoughts or opinions. Instead, your job in the time leading up to the tournament is to research and become an expert on the topic. You need to be able to find articles, read them, and pull evidence from them to build support for your side of the resolution. These articles should almost always come from reputable news sources, experts in the field, and/or law journals that have articles relating to your topic.<br />

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What can the best debaters do?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>Some of the best LD debaters can easily, quickly, and clearly express their arguments in a technical way that gets their opinions and logic across. You can view the 2019 NSDA Nationals LD Debate Final Round <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw6Nvv8UMbU">here</a> (Resolved: Violent revolution is a just response to political oppression).</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How do I keep track of the arguments my opponent makes?</button>
    <div class="fill">
      <p>The way that debaters keep track of what arguments have been made in the round is through a method known as “flowing.” Flowing is, essentially, a glorified way of taking notes. Flowing is key to ensuring that you successfully respond, or refute, your opponents case and arguments they make against your case.<br />
       <p>From the <a href="https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/Intro_to_LD.J.Roberts.7.5.27.pdf">Introduction to Lincoln-Douglas Debate</a>. The skill and process of flowing is identical and essential in all of the styles of debate.</p>
