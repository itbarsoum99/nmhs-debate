However, if you have the means, we ask that you make a donation to benefit the ASHFoundation through our <a href="https://gofund.me/cd999939">GoFundMe charity page</a>.<br/><br/>Those of us in Speech & Debate are extremely privileged to have the opportunity to practice our public speaking, interpretive, and/or debate skills on a regular basis. It's our responsibility to give back to the community as much as we can. Founded in 1946, the ASHFoundation seeks to research and raise awareness in communication sciences, audiology, and speech therapy.</p>
